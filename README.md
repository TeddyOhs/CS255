My projects were centered around my client who was developing a Driver's aid resource that included tutoring access, educational content, and appointments for in person practice on the road. I did particularly well in reading the requirements of the client and gettign an idea of the overall layout for the application and web service to be provided. I would have to revise the UML project appliances as this could be improved upon with methods used, and class separation. I went ahead and implemented the user's requirements when applying the different factors of the website such as content, appointment implementation, and educational services into a main site. As a software designer, I approach the design process by first identifying the problem or primary goal that the software is trying to solve. This helps me to understand the user needs and the foundation for the system design. This helps me to identify and understand the requirements, constraints, and assumptions of the system.
